# paymoneywubby-twitch-dl
Quick and dirty bash script to download the latest VOD using twitch-dl by ihabunek (https://github.com/ihabunek/twitch-dl), until the function is implemented in that project.

**Usage:**  
Place the file in the same directory where twitch-dl.[version].pyz is.  
Make it executable.  
./twitch-dl
